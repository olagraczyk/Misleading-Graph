# Fixing a Misleading Graph – TVP Example  

This repository demonstrates how misleading graphs can manipulate public perception and provides a corrected version. The original example aired on **TVP1 (14.03.2023)**, where the graph **exaggerated differences** between TV stations by modifying the y-axis.  

📌 **Key Fixes:**  
✔️ Adjusted the y-axis to start from **0%** instead of **7%**.  
✔️ Added percentage values **above bars** for better clarity.  
✔️ Ensured **accurate visual representation** of the data.  


I generated some of the code using **ChatGPT** to streamline the process (a great way to leverage AI tools efficiently), while other parts were written manually.
